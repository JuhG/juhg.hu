The strangest thing just happened. I went for a run and I needed a coin for the entry. I was already out of the building when I realized I forgot it. But when I checked my pocket, the coin was there.

I was really surprised. I had no memory whatsoever of putting it there. My mind went autopilot completely. I picked up my purse, looked up the exact amount I needed and put it in my pocket. Just like last time. That must be the key here. The purse was where I usually leave it. There was a coin in it that I was looking for. There were no surprises at all. So my mind was free to wander and completely pushed out that few seconds of memory.

It's moments like this when I actually realize how many things we do without thinking. It's actually scary.
