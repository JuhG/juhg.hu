## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is **GÃ¡bor**. I'm a web developer from KecskemÃ©t, Hungary.

I've been building websites **since 2014**. Most of that time I was responsible for the whole spectrum so I have a great understanding of the big picture.

Lately my choice of stack is always based on **React**, both the syntax and the ecosystem help to make it super easy to be productive. Frameworks like Gatsby, Next (and the JAM-stack in general) finally bridge the gap between UX, DX and content editing.

On the back-end I have the most experience with Laravel and Node. For testing I think Jest's watch mode is the best and Cypress is amazing in general. For bigger projects I prefer Typescript. I used to style things with SCSS, but Tailwind converted me completely. These are my preferences, but in questions like these the most important is to adhere to the team's choice.

Iâ€™m constantly experimenting with new things - even if itâ€™s only for fun. Finding new ideas can easily benefit my current work without switching the whole stack. I always take responsibility for my work and respect deadlines. It was quite important since Iâ€™ve been working from home most of my career. It has worked out for me, communicating with the team was never an issue.

I occasionally

the basics of programming. Love the open source nature of the web. Outside of programming I like hiking and riding the bike, playing board games, drinking beer with friends and watching Netflix with my wife.
