## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is **GÃ¡bor**. I'm a web developer from KecskemÃ©t, Hungary.

I'm a full stack developer, but I like to work on the front end the most, specifically with React and the ecosystem: Gatsby, Next and stuff.

I <a href="https://workshop.dromedar.design/" target="_blank">teach locally</a> the basics of programming and love the open source nature of the web.
