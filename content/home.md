## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is **GÃ¡bor**. I'm a web developer from KecskemÃ©t, Hungary.

I've been building websites **since 2014**. Lately my choice of stack is always based on **React**, the syntax stole my heart and the ecosystem is just unmatched.

In my spare time I'm usually looking for the Laravel equivalent in Typescript and enjoying a good Tailwind.

When I'm not looking at the screen, I'm probably playing with my two boys or brewing my own beer.
