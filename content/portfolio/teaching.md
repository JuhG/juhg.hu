title: Teaching

I've always had a sweet spot for teaching and I've helped some friends to build small sites,
but
[the WWK workshop](https://workshop.dromedar.design/)
was my first try at actually teaching.

Since then a
[meetup presentation](https://github.com/dromedar-design/presentation-gatsby)
and a
[few video tutorials](https://github.com/dromedar-design/tutorial-gatsby-blog)
are also in the works. I guess the simplicity of Gatsby gave me inspiration. :)
