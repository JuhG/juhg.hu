I've always wanted to publish a real app created with web technologies just to see the whole process. For this little project I've collected a few libraries I planned to try out and set a deadline to see how for I get over one weekend. The result is nothing fancy, but I've learned a lot in the process.

Typescript is amazing. Setting up XState is a bit complicated but it changes how you think about state forever. Ionic tries really hard to make app development easy. It's a noble goal but the code in the end becomes way to ionic-specific for my taste. Next time I'll go with React Native.

Technologies used:
[Ionic React](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react),
[XState](https://xstate.js.org/),
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
