This is an e-commerce selling custom made knifes. It was a super exciting project, since this is a dynamic site with Gatsby. The task was fitting, because - even though this is a shop - managing the cart had to be on the client side (for privacy reasons) and the order process is only a form submission, so no complicated backend logic or online payment was needed.

I think `useContext` has great potential. It's super simple way to have the superpower similar to Redux and extracting the functionality to a custom hook makes it all predictable. All the advantages of global state without any suprises!
