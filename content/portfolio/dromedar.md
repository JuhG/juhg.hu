title: Dromedar Design
---

While I was working at my father's company I was freelancing on evenings and weekends under the name Dromedar Design. After some time both of these came to end. While it was super exhausting and not really working out (mostly finding and communicating with clients) - I was gaining tons of experience in the process.

Having real life apps depending on me pushed me to the next level on taking responsibility and really testing things (before pushing to prod on Friday afternoon).

Some of projects (I could open source) are in of these repos:
