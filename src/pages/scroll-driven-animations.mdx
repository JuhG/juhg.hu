# Scroll-driven animations and Tailwind

Welcome to my investigation on how to implement scroll-driven animations in Tailwind CSS.
This will be a mix of an imaginary PR description and an introduction to the feature for someone who has heard of it, but not familiar with the API.

In advance, this is such an amazing tool.
It makes things possible with CSS that required a bunch of Javascript in the past.
Not that writing JS is that bad.
It's just you don't have to write the same thing over and over again.
You let the browser do the heavy lifting.
It's also _way_ more performant.

## Use cases and syntax

Let's look at a few common patterns - now with CSS only!
There's a lot more possible, for example a CSS-only carousel.
I'll add links to cool examples.

### 1. Scroll progress

I think this is the most common was to implement a scroll indicator, a small line at the top to show how much there's left from the thing you're reading.
Not sure how useful this is, but it's common nonetheless.

<Demo client:load>
  <div
    id="progress"
    className="absolute left-0 right-0 top-0 z-10 h-3 origin-left rounded bg-amber-600"
  />
</Demo>

To implement this we need some `@keyframes` defined:

```css
@keyframes KF {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
}
```

And then connect those keyframes to the progress bar element:

```css
#el {
  animation: KF linear;
  animation-timeline: scroll();
}
```

This is the same `animation` property you can use to animate something on page load or hover.
But now instead of setting the duration or iteration count, we specify the timeline - in a separate property.
The value is the `scroll()` function, it will tie the animation progress to the current scroll position.

### 2. Banner popping up

Scroll-to-top button or maybe something a bit more annoying like a subscribe form.
We don't want to show them right away.
But don't want to wait with fully showing them until the user scroll to the bottom.
So we need more control - complete the animation by the time we scroll to the half.

<Demo client:load>
  <div id="banner" className="absolute bottom-8 right-8 z-10 size-12 rounded bg-amber-600" />
</Demo>

There are two ways to achieve this, either specify a range:

```css
#el {
  animation-range: 0% 50%;
}
```

OR customize the `@keyframes` with the same percentage values:

```css
@keyframes KF {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

Both of these does the exact same thing.
Generally the `@keyframes` approach is more flexible.
I'll talk about the tradeoffs in a later section.

### 3. Enter animation

There's a big difference between this example and the previous ones.
Turn off the autoplay and play with it a bit slower!

<Demo intro client:load>
  <div id="intro" className="absolute top-0 w-full rounded bg-amber-600" />
</Demo>

The animation here is **based on the element's position on the screen** and not on the global scroll position.
This makes enter and exit animations pretty simple without any Javascript.
To use it, there's another function called `view()`.

```css
#el {
  animation-timeline: view();
}
```

### 4. Parallax

Something spooky üéÉ is going on with the last example here.
Let's see if you can figure it out!

<Demo client:load>
  <div id="parallax" className="absolute top-0 w-full">
    <div id="parallax-child" className="rounded bg-amber-600" />
  </div>
</Demo>

That's right, there are two things changing independently.
The scroll position works the same way as before.
But the height of the block is tied to the main scrollbar of the whole page - not the small window.

To customize the target we can keep using the **anonymous** scroll progress timeline:

```css
#el {
  animation-timeline: scroll(root);
}
```

So _there was a reason_ this is a function and not just a simple value.
We can customize two things here:

- the scroller element we want to track (nearest / root / self)
- and the axis (block / inline)

OR create a **named** scroll progress timeline:

```css
#scroller {
  scroll-timeline: --scroll;
}

#el {
  animation-timeline: --scroll;
}
```

We specify the timeline name with `scroll-timeline` on the scrollable element.
Then use that instead of the `scroll()` function.
Same thing is possible with `view-timeline` instead of `view()` as well.

With `timeline-scope` it's even possible to animate an element that's not descendant of the scroller.
It's a more complex syntax, but comes with a lot flexibility.
Super cool.

## API in Tailwind

Now let's talk about the complexity of the syntax and how to translate it to Tailwind classes.
As we've seen so far, the base syntax is not that crazy.
But with more complex use cases we can run into a couple of issues:

- it's usually full of custom values
- we might need to link elements far from each other

But let's start with the basics.

### Base syntax

This is the absolute minimum you need for a scroll-driven animation.

```css
#el {
  animation-timeline: scroll();
}
```

Tailwind already has animation related classes, they use the `animate-*` prefix, so let's stick to that.
Let's add the timeline keyword to differentiate from predefined animations.
How about `animate-timeline-scroll` and `animate-timeline-view`?

```css
#el {
  animation-timeline: view(root inline);
}
```

What about the options, should we stack them on top of scroll / view or add separate classes?
I vote for the latter.
It should be fairly easy to combine them with CSS variables.

So the last code block translates to `animate-timeline-view animate-timeline-root animate-timeline-inline`.
This might seem long, but I think in a lot of cases we would use the defaults, so we rarely need all three of them.

### Range

The `animation-range` property also seems straightforward.
Not sure about predefined value though.
We usually need to be pixel perfect and there are quite a lot of [special syntax for this property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-range) outside of pixel and percentage values. (normal / cover / contain / entry / exit)

So maybe for the start and end it might make sense to define round numbers, like `animate-range-start-5` and `animate-range-end-20`.
But I would leave the shorthand empty - open for arbitrary values: `animate-range-[10%_exit_90%]`.

### Keyframes

Here's the first obstacle: how to define `@keyframes` with multiple steps _in the class attribute of an element_.
I really don't want to push this too far and give haters one more reason to start a drama on Twitter. üå∂Ô∏è
So let's just assume we don't want to do that.
That leaves us with two possible options.

#### Predefine keyframes

We could extend the current set of animations (spin, bounce, etc.) and add a few more - tailored specifically for this use case.
For example this seems pretty useful:

```css
@keyframes fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

With that we can recreate the "Banner popping up" example with Tailwind classes:

```html
<div class="animate-fade-in animate-timeline-scroll animate-range-end-50 absolute bottom-0 right-0">
  Look ma, no JS!
</div>
```

And maybe a couple more could work, but we can't cover everything.
As mentioned before, we simply need more control to finetune an animation.

#### Custom keyframes

Looks like we need to get our hards dirty and open an actual CSS file.
With Tailwind v4 moving towards raw CSS with configuration, this seems like less of an issue going forward.
Applying the custom keyframes is possible even right now with the arbitrary value syntax.

Let's recreate the "Scroll progress" example:

```css
@keyframes progress {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
}
```

```html
<div class="animate-timeline-scroll absolute left-0 right-0 top-0 animate-[progress_linear]"></div>
```

That's it.
Even though we're splitting logic between the markup and the CSS file, I'm personally ok with this.
First of all the animation part was usually done in code before and not inside the class attribute anyway.
Probably still closer (in case of `framer-motion` for example), but separated nonetheless.

The separation here is pretty clear.
Add every detail about the animation to the keyframes and keep all the usual styling as classes.
This approach also makes `animation-range` relatively useless, move that inside the keyframes too.

Maybe there's some crazy syntax like `animate-from-[transform:scaleX(0)] animate-to-[transform:scaleX(1)]`, but I wouldn't go there.
That smells like over-abstracting.

### Choosing a target

We can say that it's advanced topic and not cover this at all.
Not to mention `timeline-scope`.
Just like `display: grid;` has named areas that's not available through Tailwind.
It's fine.
As a thought experiment let's think about it for a second _anyway_.

My first idea is to make it similar to `@container`.
Special syntax - you need to connect multiple elements.
`@scroll` is transformed to `scroll-timeline` and `@view` to `view-timeline`.
But we need a name - do we put it inside brackets or not?

We'll need brackets for the `animate-timeline-*` class, so let's try to make it a bit more visually clear.
Tailwind is a compiler, so we can do whatever we want, right?
Also the `@` symbol kind of signals something special is going on here - at least that's how I see it.

So how does that look like?

```html
<div class="@scroll-square">
  <div class="animate-timeline-[square]">...</div>
</div>
```

I don't know.
Maybe better with the brackets?

Or just simply add these props as they are and rely on arbitrary values?
But in that case we have to explain that those values must start with a double dash.
Or do we just check for dashes and add them if they're missing?
Too much magic?

```html
<div class="timeline-scope-[--square]">
  <div class="scroll-timeline-[--square]">...</div>
  <div class="animate-timeline-[--square]">...</div>
</div>
```

I feel like this looks ok.
Or just go with the first instinct and not implement them?
What do _you_ think?
