# Hey Adam & Tailwind team!

I'm Gabor, I live in Hungary (eastern Europe) and I've been working as a web developer for 10 years.
I wasn't really looking, but this is my absolute dream job.
I've been following your work since "Refactoring to collections", using <Button modal="history" client:load>Tailwind since 2018</Button> and learned so much from your podcasts.
But enough fanboyism, why am I a good candidate?

  <p>
    Since most of my professional work is closed source, I've put together an article on one of your
    proposed topics to demonstrate my ability to explain things, create delightful experiences and
    theorycraft new APIs.

## About me

What do I consider my greatest strengths?

- **Problem solving** - probably common among programmers, but it's my favorite thing to do.
  I like to experiment with new technologies, figure out new solutions to old problems.
- **Attention to detail** - <Button modal="diablo" client:load>always went too far</Button> and tried to make things perfect.
  Lately found a way to enjoy compromise - meet business requirements in time and ship _working incomplete solutions_ to production that we can iterate on later.
- **Take ownership of the work** - I like responsibility and seeing the big picture - then breaking down the project into smaller tasks.
  I'm most productive when working independently while there are people challenging my work.

## Experience

Currently I'm leading a team that maintains an internal React component library.
We spend a lot of time figuring out the best possible API while maintaining backwards compatibility.
There's around 100 frontend devs using it and a huge amount of "legacy" React code where these components are used.

It's my responsibility to keep in touch with designers.
They communicate what business wants and I translate it to code.
We often need to compromise - usually not because of deadlines, just around complexity.

> Do we change it globally, make it a boolean prop or a string with variants?

Is it `shadow={true}` or `shadow="xl"`?
This question comes up a lot.
Consistency vs flexibility - this is the name of the game.
Should we limit developers or just let them <Button modal="button" client:load>go wild</Button>?

We use a pretty cool tool called [UXPin merge](https://www.uxpin.com/merge) that allows designers to use our components in a drag and drop editor.
This really limits component design.
Makes it interesting.
Whenever we add a new prop, we have to think about if it would work in a text input.
Configuration object props ruled out instantly.

This is one of the reasons we started creating compound components.
They have other advantages: for example subcomponents can have their own props - much nicer API.
(Loved the podcast about Catalyst component design.)
But then what happens if they are used in the wrong order?
Back to the question above.

> Consistency / flexibility / lack of complexity - pick two

Would love to talk about all this in detail, I think there's quite a lot of overlap with your work.

<hr />

Previously <Button modal="freelancing" client:load>I was freelancing</Button> and worked on cool projects mostly on my own, while also doing all the business stuff, like finding and talking to clients.
Technology-wise Laravel, Vue, React and obviously Tailwind. ðŸ˜‰

Before that I was working at a marketing agency.
Websites there were marketing material with <Button modal="agency" client:load>super fancy design</Button> - that's when I learned CSS really deep.

Always tried to be an all round fullstack web developer, but when I had to choose I picked frontend.
Mainly because I care - whoever my customer is (developer or end-user) I just want them to have a pleasant experience.
I put myself in their shoes and try to ask the questions they would ask.
Then improve the product / documentation / email to answer them.
Then do it again until it feels right.

## Facts

Maybe this was a bit too deep dive, but wanted to show a general picture of the problems I run into on a daily basis.
To make the rest short, I'll drop a couple of one sentence facts about myself.

- Involved with frontend infrastructure, writing webpack configs, loading federated modules, analyzing what gets bundled.
- Leading a small team, part of the hiring process and mentoring juniors.
- Love writing documentation, finding the optimal way of demonstrating concepts, creating interactive playgrounds.
- Always <Button modal="tools" client:load>try to be proactive</Button> and build tools to make processes more streamlined and unified for developers.
- Half my colleagues are in the US (Seattle), so timezone is definitely not an issue.
- Have two kids (1 and 3.5 yo) - it's the most interesting experience in the world and just super tiring at the same time.
- Pretty good with CSS, although probably can't recreate Mona Lisa with a single div - is that required for a Design Engineer? <Button modal="thinking" client:load>We'll see!</Button>
