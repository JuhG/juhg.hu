## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, my name is GÃ¡bor

I'm a web developer from KecskemÃ©t, Hungary. I've been building websites since 2014. Most of that time I was responsible for the whole spectrum so I have a great understanding of the big picture.

Lately my choice of stack is always based on React, both the syntax and the ecosystem help to make it super easy to be productive.

I mainly use this site - like many web devs do with their personal site - to test new frameworks. This latest iteration was built with <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>. If not, then I forgot to change it when copying from the old version. ðŸ˜‰

When I'm not rebuilding my blog I prefer to work with Typescript.

Outside of work I enjoy reading, playing computer and board games, drinking beer and spending time with my family (wife and 2yo son) - for example hiking / travelling.
