# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

My name is GÃ¡bor.
I'm a web developer from KecskemÃ©t, Hungary.
I've been building websites since 2014.
Most of that time I was responsible for the whole spectrum so I have a great understanding of the big picture.

Lately my choice of stack is always based on React.
Love the syntax and the ecosystem is just unmatched.
Paired with Tailwind it's a colocation dream.
In my spare time I'm usually looking for the Laravel equivalent in Typescript.

Outside of work I enjoy reading, playing computer and board games, brewing (and drinking) beer and spending time with my family - wife and 2 boys.
