# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

<Image src={image} alt="Gabor" class="float-end mt-0 w-40 px-4 sm:w-48" />

My name is **Gabor**.
I'm a product engineer obsessed with crafting great experiences.
Working on the web since 2014.

I'm good at

- writing maintainable Typescript
- mentoring and leading developers
- turning business goals into technical plans
- understanding the language designers speak
- distilling information into shorter form

Technologies I like include React, Node, Tailwind, Laravel and lately the web platform itself.
CSS is getting crazy good and I'm here for it.
I always prefer the simplest solution, which usually means avoiding early abstractions.
Over the years I've learned to live with incomplete solutions and iterating on them as we get familiar with the problem space.

Outside of work I enjoy running (while listening to podcasts), reading, playing computer and board games, brewing (and drinking) beer and spending time with my family - wife and 2 boys.
