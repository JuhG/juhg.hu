# Gabor Juhasz

I'm a **product engineer** obsessed with crafting great experiences.
Working on the web since 2014.

I'm good at writing **maintainable Typescript**, both client (mainly react) and server side.
I have experience **mentoring** and **leading** developers.
I take **full ownership** of the projects I work on, sweating all the important details without getting lost in them.
I'm happy to turn business goals into technical plans and I (usually) understand the language designers speak.
One of my biggest strengths is my ability to **distill information into shorter form**.

Keyword soup: typescript, react, node, tailwind, next, rsc, remix, astro, drizzle, tanstack-query, zod, cva, shadcn, framer-motion, lucia, jotai, panda-css, prettier, storybook, laravel, livewire.
(technologies I used lately, happy to chat about them)
