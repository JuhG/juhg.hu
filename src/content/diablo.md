# Diablo

I remember 20 years ago when playing Diablo 2 with my brother I always wanted to complete all the quests and find all the waypoints.
There wasn't really a reward after a certain point, but for some reason it gave me a satisfaction to see a complete list.
This turned into super complex excel tables - nobody understood why would I spend so much time on such insignificant details.
Myself included.

And then I started working and all my employers were very satisfied when I went above and beyond - promotions came easy.
Hah...
Turns out it's useful for something after all.
