# Tools and processes

You can't beat sync communication, especially if you already have the info needed to make a decision.
But while in the process of investigation, my favorite way of communicating is long comments on PRs.
Collect all the links / resources on the topic, build small playgrounds, create comparisons, post screenshots and gifs.
Form an opinion and ask for feedback.
Schedule a meeting when everyone has all the necessary info.

I try not to be obsessed with tooling.
But you can't stop me if it affects consistency.
I've created the eslint plugin in my company to have a consistent ruleset.
Also created a new eslint rule - it was fun working with the AST.

Love building small tools like `bump` to standardize changelog across repos.
Might be insignificant, but it matters.
Like how `prettier` changed our lives.
Remember what it was like before?
