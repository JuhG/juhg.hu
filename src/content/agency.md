# Design

I'm very far from a designer, but I'm pretty good at telling which design is better if I see two next to each other.
That's because I've seen a lot of good ones and improved my taste over time.
You can say I'm design-adjacent.

At this agency the backend was usually Wordpress, sometimes Laravel, but we always focused on how it looks.
There were single-use microsites, blogs, small games, event registration, lots of email templates (ugh!) and of course the admin panel to input the content.

Also my wife is a designer, so I'm exposed to a lot of instagram and design opinions.
Currently she is mostly doing illustrations while being a full-time mom.

Personally I like clean and simple design that's easy to scan and see the hierarchy.
It takes a real designer to also make it pleasant to look at.
