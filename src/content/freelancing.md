It's hard.

My father was an entrepreneur so that's what I've seen all my life.
And when you see how much the agency gets for the project you're doing solo - and how much they pay you - you start to wonder.

I can do that! (hold my beer)
Nope, it's much easier to write code than finding and keeping customers.
You need a whole different skillset to do that.

I still have ambitions, a couple of saas ideas, but don't want to push it with two young kids.
Always the excuses, I know, but I'm trying to be more intentional with my time.
Had a fair share of 80 hour weeks early in my career.

Also you can't fail if you don't even try. ðŸ™‚
Fow now I'm gathering info from podcasts like "Hackers Incorporated".
