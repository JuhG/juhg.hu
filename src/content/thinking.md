# Inner monolog

You know what I'm thinking: what chance do I have against superstars on Twitter?
Against people who are active in Discord groups and organizing conferences?
Not much I guess.

Maybe this is too much meta thinking.
I should write this in a vacuum, focusing only on the job itself.
But it's damn hard knowing that thousands of people will apply.

So what can I show that's public?
Outside of my (mostly trivial) personal projects all my professional work was closed source.
Internally in my company I'm pretty active.
Leading the conversations about technology and ideas, creating tools.
Even gave a couple of talks, even if only to ~10 people. ðŸ™‚
